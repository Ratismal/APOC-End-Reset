# Programmed By: Capsar, FreakyFalse of the APOC Gaming Dev Team
# Idea & Config By: Zilacon

#
# Below is the configurable options for the plugin. You can set the total experience for the dragon.
# The distribution of the rewards. The delay of the end resetting. Locking down the end.
# And where the players will be teleported when the dragon is killed.
#
# This plugin regenerates the world with the same seed it was created with.
# So as long as the level.dat file is intact for the world the seed will remain unchanged.
# This makes it easy to setup warps to the end as the platform for the end will never change.

# This is the TOTAL experience that will be distributed between all players that killed the dragon. (22075 = 100 levels)
total-exp: 22075
# Do you want the player who killed the dragon to get the dragon egg?
reward-egg: true
# Where should we teleport the players after we close the end?
# Choose the name of the world and the coordinates X,Y,Z to where they will spawn at. If you set X,Y,Z to all to 0, players will be teleported to their bed location or spawn.
end-tp-world: world
end-tp-X: 0
end-tp-Y: 0
end-tp-Z: 0
# The time the players have left in the end after killing the dragon before they get teleported to the given coordinates above. (In minutes)
end-tp-out-delay: 2
# The end is in lockdown (nobody can enter) between these 2 times.
# How long until the world is reset in minutes? (After the dragon is killed)
end-reset-time: 3
